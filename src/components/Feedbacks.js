                        <p>I have a 7-year-old son and a 13 years old daughter. They are the students at Darul Islam Online. There is neither Islamic School nor a Mosque around us where my children may go to learn Islam. I want to say that my children have been learning about Islam with Darul Islam Online. Alhamdulillah, my children are now successful to read Quran and they have learned a lot about Islam. I am absolutely happy that my children have learned from Darul Islam Online about Islam.
                            I am really thankful to Darul Islam Online for teaching my children beautiful things.
                            May Allah succeed them their way.
